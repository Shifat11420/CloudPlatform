ok, so we have an input stream which will periodically get information, which may be partial.

that stream might say:

     //I'm a new node, add me as a neighbor.
     I want work.
     I am done with work, here is my answer.
     
Just do these for now.

messagedispatcher
	recieves "I want work"
	Sends "Work"
	Work is - tarred container.  containerID.  argument file(s).
	
	recieves "I am done with work"
	recieves file(s) which are work completion.
	What does it do with them? Needs to match argument with results.  Send those back?  is that redundant, or safe?  
	     Some kind of reduce.

How does client work?
    Need the ability to spawn a client -for a reason-
    so the client itself will be "Asking for work client"
    or "Sending File Client"
