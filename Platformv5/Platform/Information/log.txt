On 11/2 I logged into cloudlab, started an experiment with profile
docker-one
on emulab
installed from docker hub, and ran the server with the command

docker run --privileged -p IPADDRESS:PORT:PORT bpete16/distplatform:0.1 /bin/bash Platform/ScriptsDocker/StartServer.bash IPADDRESS PORT

Then I killed the server from coates machine with the injector command

python RunInjector.py KillCloudlabServer.dat

This shows the promise of connections.  Need to work on building a good experiment now.

11/4 - testing neighbor information injector uncovered stupid bug.  fixed and rebuilding with command
